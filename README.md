# My dotfiles

Using Zsh on Mac OSX.

Cobbled together from a variety of sources over the years.

The bulk of my dotfiles live under the `files` directory.

## Installation

This repo includes [Babushka](http://babushka.me/) scripts and [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) bundles to bootstrap up an OSX machine how I like it. The details of which can be found in [Installation](Installation.md).
